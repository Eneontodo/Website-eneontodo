# Eneontodo — Official Website

A minimalistic landing page for **Eneontodo**, providing configuration files for internet access solutions via **Hiddify**.

## 🌐 Overview

This single-page website serves as a digital business card offering:
- Direct download of Hiddify-compatible configuration files
- Quick access to official Telegram channels for updates and support

## ✨ What's improved

- **Performance & maintainability:** JavaScript logic moved to `scripts/main.js` with reusable handlers.
- **Accessibility:** better semantic structure, navigation anchors, live status messaging, `rel="noopener noreferrer"` for external links.
